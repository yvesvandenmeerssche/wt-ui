# Content

We recommend to put the main content inside a `#app-content` wrapper, just belo the `#app-header`. This content block should be used only once per page.

This element has some spacing styles that work well with the header and the footer.

```html
<div id="app-content" role="main">
  <!-- Main content goes here -->
</div>
```
